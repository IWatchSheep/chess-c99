 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. HOW CHESS WORKS ON A COMPUTER BOARD (THE COORDINATE SYSTEM)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A standard chessboard is a grid of 64 squares arranged in 8 rows and 8 columns.
 *
 * In chess notation:
 *   - Columns are called "FILES" and are labeled with letters 'a' through 'h'.
 *   - Rows are called "RANKS" and are numbered 1 through 8.
 *
 * In C programming, arrays are 0-indexed:
 *   Piece board[8][8];  // board[row][col]
 *
 * Here is how the 2D array row and column indices map to the chessboard:
 *
 *   Array Row 0  = Chess Rank 8  (Black major pieces start here: a8 to h8)
 *   Array Row 1  = Chess Rank 7  (Black pawns start here: a7 to h7)
 *   Array Row 2  = Chess Rank 6
 *   Array Row 3  = Chess Rank 5
 *   Array Row 4  = Chess Rank 4
 *   Array Row 5  = Chess Rank 3
 *   Array Row 6  = Chess Rank 2  (White pawns start here: a2 to h2)
 *   Array Row 7  = Chess Rank 1  (White major pieces start here: a1 to h1)
 *
 *   Array Col 0 = File 'a'    Array Col 4 = File 'e'
 *   Array Col 1 = File 'b'    Array Col 5 = File 'f'
 *   Array Col 2 = File 'c'    Array Col 6 = File 'g'
 *   Array Col 3 = File 'd'    Array Col 7 = File 'h'
 *
 * Conversions:
 *   - To get rank number from array row:    rank_number  = 8 - array_row
 *   - To get array row from rank number:    array_row    = 8 - rank_number
 *   - To get file letter from array column: file_letter  = 'a' + array_col
 *   - To get array column from file letter: array_col    = file_letter - 'a'
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2. TWO-STEP INTERACTIVE MOVE WORKFLOW
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * To help players understand move consequences, this program uses a two-step
 * workflow before any move is finalized:
 *
 * Step 1: Piece Selection
 *   - Enter a starting square (for example, "d2" or "e2").
 *   - The board redraws with:
 *       [P] = Your selected piece enclosed in square brackets.
 *       *   = An empty square that this piece can legally move to.
 *       (p) = An opponent piece that your piece can legally capture.
 *
 * Step 2: Move Preview & Comparative Analysis
 *   - Enter a destination square (for example, "d4" or "e4").
 *   - The move is NOT committed yet!
 *   - A temporary simulation of the board is created.
 *   - A two-column report compares every other piece on the board BEFORE
 *     and AFTER your proposed move, showing newly GAINED destination squares,
 *     LOST destination squares, and UNCHANGED squares.
 *
 * Finalization:
 *   - Press 'F' (or 'f') then Enter to finalize and commit the previewed move.
 *   - Press 'P' (or 'p') then Enter to clear the preview and test another destination.
 *   - Press 'N' (or 'n') then Enter to cancel piece selection and choose another piece.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 3. ADVANCED ANALYTICAL STAGES
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - FEN ("fen <string>" / "fen"): Set up or inspect arbitrary board positions.
 * - R Report ("r" or "R"): Detailed fact report after previewing a move.
 * - Replies ("replies" / "replies <move>"): Analysis of all opponent responses.
 * - Loop ("loop N" / "loop N K"): Exhaustive game tree search up to N plies.
 * - Trace ("trace <moves>"): Replay a sequence of moves with full fact logs.
 * - Goals & Routes ("goal <squares> <N>", "routes", "support"): Pathfinding.
 * - Exchanges ("exchange <square> <N>", "order <N>", "risk on"): Material calculus.
 * - Compare ("compare N m1 m2 ..."): Side-by-side comparison of candidate moves.
